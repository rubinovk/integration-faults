Integration Faults
==================

This is a point to share and collect [examples](https://github.com/rubinovk/integration-faults/tree/master/examples) 
of integration faults for the common good.  
  
__Integration faults__ are like zombies: some people think they exist, bring a  
lot of harm and shall be hunted down, and destroyed.  Others think they exist  
only on TV and one can just unit test their code and sleep easy.  
  
We are here to separate myths from reality by sharing examples of real  
integration faults (if they exist).  
  
Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/rubinovk/integration-faults/wiki) section 
to learn more and share your experience.
